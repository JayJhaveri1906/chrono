# CHRONO :robot: :space_invader: :hourglass_flowing_sand: :watch:	:blue_car: :racehorse: :motorcycle:

Chrono bridges the gap between sci-fi and reality by taking users on a journey through time and space with unique and creative rides.

 App powered by: Flutter (https://flutter.dev) :zap:

# INSPIRATION

Chrono was inspired by retro  and sci-fi concepts of what transit would look like  in the future. We  imagine that the world of transit would feature high tech rides that could not only travel through space but also through time. Chrono was created as a way for people to easily access these rides through a friendly and innovative app design. Built using Flutter, Google Cloud Platform,  Adobe XD, and After Effects, we bring together not only stunning design but also great functionality.
